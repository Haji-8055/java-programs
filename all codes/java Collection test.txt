question1.	

									Iterable is parent most interface of collection

collection is a presentation of group of objects as single entity	

				collection is further extended by following  hierarchy

	1.List               2.Set         3.SortedSet        4.Map               5.Queue
	
	implementation classes
	
	a.ArrayList     	a.HashSet			.TreeSet        a.HashMap				.TreeSet
	b.LinkedList		b.LinkedHashSet						b.LinkedHashMap
	
	
*The List can contain duplicate elements 			* Set includes unique items.
*The List is an ordered collection 					*Set is an unordered collection which 
 which maintains the insertion order.  			      does not preserve the insertion order.
*The List interface can allow n 					*whereas Set interface only allows a single null value.
number of null values 
* it has separate listIterator						*does not have any iterator
*it allows positional access,that is 				*it is non index based
	indexed based
	
question2.

*HashMap maintains no order, but TreeMap maintains ascending order.
*HashMap can be sorted by Key or value whereas TreeMap can be sorted by Key.
*HashMap can have a null key with multiple null values,,  TreeMap cannot hold a null key but can have multiple null values.


question3.	
HashSet maintains no order where as TreeSet maintains ascending order.
HashSet performs faster than TreeSet.

question18.
*we can split string
*we can convert a string to stream of chars
*we can join strings

question10.
dependecy injection is the process of getting reference to a property using spring with the 
help of annotation @autowired

question11.
 by making a .java file as component ad .class file as bean ,when we provide package to a spring it will create beans out of all the component and beans within the same package
 
 question12.
 yes we can have more than one configuration class in a project,,when we use annotation @Configuration on a class 
 and pass the reference to spring implementation class.
 
 question15.
 @Component :- it used for .java files,,,it indicates that spring has to create a bean of it
 @ComponentScan:-it indicates in which package spring has to manage objects
 @Bean :-  it used for .class files,we have to declare and intitilaize but spring will only manage it
